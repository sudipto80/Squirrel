[`Squirrel LOGO is designed by Pirog tetyana from The Noun Project`](https://raw.github.com/sudipto80/Squirrel/newb/img/license.txt)

Squirrel is a comprehensive data processing and analytics framework designed specifically for .NET developers. It transforms messy data into insights through an intuitive, business-readable API that makes data cleaning, analysis, and visualization accessible to both developers and business users.

<img src="https://www.pocketsolution.net/img/mac-linux-windows.png"/>

Squirrel is built on .NET Standard 2.0

## ‚ö° Quick Start

```csharp
using Squirrel;

// Load, clean, and analyze data in a readable pipeline
var insights = DataAcquisition.LoadCsv("sales_data.csv")
    .RemoveOutliers("amount")
    .NormalizeColumn("customer_name", NormalizationStrategy.NameCase)
    .RemoveNonMatches("email", @"^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$")
    .SortBy("amount");

insights.PrettyDump();
```

## üéØ Why Squirrel?

Data Analytics and Big Data are now the buzz words of the industry. Today many businesses want to drive their businesses using Data Analytics ‚Äì by gaining insights from their data. Aesthetically pleasing data visualizations with agility are key for effective discovery of insights. And better insight requires a bunch of special skills ‚Äì an expertise in the field of [Data Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science). But are Data Scientists easy to come by?

Most of the datasets used by businesses are not anywhere near Big. Actually they are Tiny to Medium. A typical dataset has only few thousand rows! Professor [Alex Smola](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smola) has named datasets based on their sizes as follows:

| Dataset Size | Name |
|:-------------|:-----|
| Dataset that can fit in your mobile phone | Tiny |
| Dataset that can fit in your laptop (1GB) | Small |
| Dataset that can fit in your workstation (4 GB) | Medium |
| Dataset that can fit in your server | Large |
| When clusters of your servers struggle | Big |

Businesses are so sold up to the idea of Big data (it has almost become a status symbol) that they ignore the power of small data tools developed in-house in deriving their insights. So could software developers replace the need of the Data Scientist in answering most questions that involve Tiny or Medium datasets?

**The .NET Data Gap**: While Python has pandas and R has comprehensive data tools, .NET developers have lacked a mature, integrated solution for data processing. Squirrel fills this gap with:

- **Business-Readable Code**: Pipelines read like specifications, not technical implementation
- **Complete Data Platform**: Generate, clean, analyze, and visualize data in one framework
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Create datasets from formulas and scientific calculations
- **Performance Optimized**: Processes 100k rows in under 1 second
- **Enterprise Ready**: Built-in compliance features (GDPR, HIPAA) and data masking capabilities

**Squirrel** brings the application closer to the Business user by delivering the ability to acquire and visualize data from a variety of sources to their personal devices. We envision smart abilities in Squirrel that would bring agile data analytic solution development and delivery to near real time.

## üìä Core Capabilities

### Data Generation & Mathematical Modeling
Create datasets from mathematical formulas and scientific calculations:
```csharp
// Generate time series data for physics simulation
var model = new Table();
model.AddColumn("Time", Enumerable.Range(1, 60).Select(x => x.ToString()).ToList());
model.AddColumn("X", "Sqrt(9.81*0.25/68.1)*[Time]", 4);
model.AddColumn("Speed", @"Sqrt (9.81*68.1/0.25) * (Exp([X])-Exp(-[X]))/(Exp([X])+Exp(-[X]))", 5);

// Visualize the mathematical model
var chart = model.Pick("Time", "Speed")
    .ToBarChartByGoogleDataVisualization("Time", "Speed at a given time", 
                                        "Speed of bungee jumper");
```

### Data Acquisition
Load and save data from/to multiple sources/destinations.
```csharp
var data = DataAcquisition.LoadCsv("file.csv");
var table = DataAcquisition.LoadHtml(tableHtml);
var data = DataAcquisition.LoadParquet("file.parquet");
var data = DataAcquisition.LoadCsv("file.csv");
tab.ToCsv("logs.csv");
// Reading from anonymous type list
var fromMemory = Enumerable.Range(1,10).Select( n => new { Name = $"Name {n}", Data = n })
                                       .ToTableFromAnonList();

```

### Data Cleaning & Validation
Comprehensive cleaning functions with natural language naming:
```csharp
cleanData = messyData
    .RemoveIfNotBetween("age", 18, 120)
    .RemoveNonMatches("email", emailRegex)
    .NormalizeColumn("name", NormalizationStrategy.NameCase)
    .RemoveIncompleteRows();
```

### Statistical Analysis
Built-in statistical functions and aggregations:
```csharp
var outliers = data.ExtractOutliers("revenue");
// data is a table instance 
var summary = data.Gist();
```

### Data Visualization
Ready-made connectors to popular visualization libraries:
```csharp
data.ToBarChartByGoogleDataVisualization( "revenue", "region", "revenue per region");
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

<img src="squirrel_block.png" width="600">

Squirrel follows a layered architecture enabling complete data workflows:
- **Data Generation Layer**: Mathematical formulas and calculated columns
- **Data Acquisition Layer**: Multiple format and source support  
- **Processing Engine**: Immutable operations with method chaining
- **Analysis Layer**: Statistical functions and business intelligence
- **Visualization Layer**: Integration with industry-standard charting libraries

Data analytics solution development using **Squirrel** follows a templatized design style. As a Data Scientist would, a software developer using Squirrel too would solve a data analytics problem by stacking his solution starting with Data acquisition, followed by Data modeling & cleansing and then topping up with appropriate Data visualization. Applying Bootstrap to the visualization is automatic, bringing agility to development without compromising on quality of user experience.

## üîß Key Design Philosophy

Here are couple of design decisions that have been the guiding principle for the choice of internal data structure for Squirrel `Table` data structure to make data accessing/manipulating more intuitive and efficient at the same time:

* Each row in the table should be available by zero based integer indexing as we do in arrays and `List<T>`. So if a table `birthRates` exists then we should be able to get to 10th row by the syntax `birthRates[9]`
* A column at a given index should be available by the column name index. So if we have a table `StockValues` that stores average stock values in a year of different companies where the row depicts the year and the column depicts the company for which the stock price is stored, then we should be able to get the stock price for Microsoft (Symbol "MSFT") for 5th year as `StockValues[4]["MSFT"]`
* Value at row "k" (Expressed as an integer) and column "m" (Expressed as a string) has to be accessible by either of the syntax `table[k]["m"]` or `table["m"][k]`.


## üöÄ Installation

### NuGet Package Manager
```
Install-Package TableAPI
```

### .NET CLI
```
dotnet add package TableAPI
```

### Package Manager UI
Search for "TableAPI" in Visual Studio's Package Manager

Although the package is named `TableAPI` the namespaces to import is Squirrel like:

```csharp
using Squirrel;
``` 

and in F#:

```fsharp 
open Squirrel
open Squirrel.FSharp
```

## üí° Real-World Examples

### Customer Data Cleaning Pipeline
```csharp
var cleanCustomers = messyCustomerData
    .NormalizeColumn("name", NormalizationStrategy.NameCase)
    .RemoveNonMatches("email", @"^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$")
    .Transform("phone", phone => FormatPhoneNumber(phone))
    .RemoveIfNotBetween("registration_date", startDate, endDate)
    .MaskColumn("ssn", MaskingStrategy.StarExceptLastFour);
```

### Financial Analytics
```csharp
var analysis = transactionData
    .RemoveOutliers("amount")
    .SortBy("amount")
    .ToBarChartByGoogleDataVisualization ("amount", "Amounts", "Sales Amounts");
```
